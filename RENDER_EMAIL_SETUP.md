# 🚀 Render Email Setup Guide

## ✅ Dynamic Email System for Production

Your email system is now configured to work on Render without losing MySQL database connection.

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Independent Email System**
- Emails send even if database is down
- Registration continues regardless of database status
- Real-time email notifications on Render

### 2. **Dynamic Event Loading**
- Registration form loads categories from admin-added events
- No static categories - everything is dynamic
- Events update automatically when admin adds new ones

## 📋 Render Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Render

Go to: **Render Dashboard → Your Service → Environment → Add Environment Variable**

**Required Email Variables:**
```bash
EMAIL_USER=srinivasgalla30@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=qkzo owkl dkzy epti
EMAIL_FROM=srinivasgalla30@gmail.com
ADMIN_EMAIL=srinivasgalla30@gmail.com
JWT_SECRET=<generate-secure-random-string>
```

**Database Variables (keep existing):**
```bash
DB_HOST=<your-existing-db-host>
DB_USER=<your-existing-db-user>
DB_PASSWORD=<your-existing-db-password>
DB_NAME=<your-existing-db-name>
DB_PORT=18031
DB_SSL=true
```

### Step 2: Generate JWT Secret

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Render

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add dynamic email system for Render"
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 What Happens Now

### When User Registers:
1. ✅ **Form loads dynamic categories** from admin-added events
2. ✅ **User selects events** from dynamic sub-categories
3. ✅ **Registration submits** successfully
4. ✅ **User gets confirmation email** (real-time)
5. ✅ **Admin gets notification email** (real-time)
6. ✅ **Works even if database is down**

### Admin Can:
1. ✅ **Add new categories** in admin dashboard
2. ✅ **Add new events** under categories
3. ✅ **Events appear immediately** in registration form
4. ✅ **Get notified** when users register

## 📧 Email Templates

### User Confirmation Email
- **Subject:** "🎉 College Fest Registration Confirmed!"
- **Content:** Professional HTML with registration details
- **Includes:** Name, branch, selected events, registration date

### Admin Notification Email

## 🔍 Testing on Render

### 1. Test Registration Form
- Go to: `https://your-app.onrender.com/event-register`
- Fill out the form with your email
- Submit and check your inbox

### 2. Test Admin Dashboard
- Go to: `https://your-app.onrender.com/admin`
- Add new categories and events
- Check if they appear in registration form

### 3. Monitor Logs
- Go to: Render Dashboard → Your Service → Logs
- Look for: "Email transporter verified successfully"
- Look for: "User email sent successfully to: <email>"

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending?

**Check Gmail Settings:**
1. Enable 2-Step Verification: https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Generate App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Update `EMAIL_PASSWORD` in Render dashboard

**Check Render Logs:**
- Look for email verification errors
- Check if Gmail credentials are correct

### Database Connection Issues?

**The system now handles this gracefully:**
- Registration continues even if database is down
- Emails still send successfully
- User gets confirmation regardless

**Check Admin Dashboard:**
1. Make sure you've added categories
